# dim-wish-list-sources
Source files for wish lists for [DIM (Destiny Item Manager)](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager)

This is really just a repository for generated DIM wish lists - for documentation on what they are and how to format them, [go to DIM's documentation on the matter](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/blob/master/docs/COMMUNITY_CURATIONS.md).

If you're looking to build your own lists, [I have a tool that can help generate permutations for you](https://48klocs.github.io/wish-list-magic-wand/fingerwave.html) - the source for it [is here](https://github.com/48klocs/wish-list-magic-wand).
